==================================================

What is this?
--------------------------------------

A group (now there is only one set but there will be more in the future) of code templates for fast web development.

At what kind of projects should I use this?
--------------------------------------

Those which meet the followings:

1. Short time projects (from minutes to a few days).
2. High browser compatibility standards (IE6+)
3. Responsive capable

What does this include?
--------------------------------------

- **jQuery**: Latest stable version (1.X as we need IE 6+ support)
- **Selectivizr**: CSS3 selectors for IE
- **Modernizr**: Helps to detect browser capabilities and loads [polyfills](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills)
- **PIE**: enables some CSS3 features in IE
- **cssfx**: creates browser-compatible css code so you don't have to write -moz/webkit/ms- anymore
- **polyfill.placeholder.js**: just for `placeholder` attribute in form inputs
